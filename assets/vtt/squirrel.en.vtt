00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In the forest, a cute squirrel appears.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Its eyes are round, keenly observing the surroundings.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It finds a nut and tightly holds it with its tiny paws.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The squirrel sits on a branch and begins nibbling carefully.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The shell of the nut slowly cracks open, making a soft sound.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It eats with great delight, its tail slightly twitching.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Finally, the squirrel licks its lips contentedly,
quietly enjoying this tasty treat.
